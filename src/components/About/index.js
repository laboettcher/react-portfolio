      <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
      <p>I have a certificate in Full Stack Development from UCLA Extension, which I completed in April 2023. This bootcamp helped me to develop a number of programming skills with the help of experienced, working developers. Over the course of six months, I worked on both individual and group projects. I am now comfortable with React.js, Express.js, CSS libraries such as Tailwind and Chakra UI, Node.js, MongoDB and MongoODM, JavaScript, and MySQL. However, I am constantly learning more about programming and furthering my skills.</p>
